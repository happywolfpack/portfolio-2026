## Overview

One of the top reasons users cancel Buildertrend subscriptions is feeling overwhelmed learning the software. We investigated whether navigation and feature presentation contributed to this problem.

The challenge: users wouldn't explicitly connect navigation design to their sense of overwhelm. We needed to collect evidence showing the current navigation was problematic and present improved alternatives.

## Problems Identified

### Problem A: Categorization

The current top-level organization divided 32 features into four groups: sales, project management, file management, and financials. Card sorting research at a 60% agreement threshold showed users couldn't reach consensus on feature categorization.

<Callout type="insight">
The dendrogram of card sorting results showed it was difficult for users to agree on what groups certain features belong to. For example, the estimating feature was split — some viewed it as sales-related, others as financial.
</Callout>

### Problem B: Feature Usage

Usage data revealed the average user utilized only four features. This raised the question: did all 32 features need constant accessibility?

### Problem C: Job Menu

The job menu filtering component had two issues: its visual design didn't communicate its filter functionality, and it consumed excessive screen real estate despite infrequent job switching.

## Proposed Solutions

Our redesign was grounded in three design principles:

<ProcessStep number={1} title="Clear Hierarchy">
Shifted feature navigation to the left sidebar (expanding on hover) since users switch features more frequently than jobs. This prioritized workspace real estate — what matters most to users.
</ProcessStep>

<ProcessStep number={2} title="Mental Model Alignment">
Redesigned the job menu as a dropdown filter positioned top-left, using standard UI conventions so users immediately understood its filtering purpose.
</ProcessStep>

<ProcessStep number={3} title="Personalization and Customization">
Limited the feature set to eight core features with three recently-used features below a divider line. Users could customize and pin features, and the system used usage data to surface frequently-accessed features.
</ProcessStep>

</BeforeAfter>

## User Testing Results

We tested the current versus redesigned navigation with 20 users (10 per version):

- **System Usability Scale:** Existing scored 84.24/100; proposed scored **96/100** (+11.76 points)
- **Feature navigation speed:** Proposed was **3.6 seconds faster** on average
- **Sidebar default features:** **6.5 seconds faster** on average
- **Job menu switching:** Decreased from 23 seconds to **14.5 seconds** (8.5s improvement)

## Outcome

Leadership response was lukewarm. While some stakeholders aligned on the identified problems and appreciated the solution, organizational priority shifts led to deprioritizing navigation changes.

## Takeaways

<Callout type="note">
Proving that abstract navigation issues directly caused churn was difficult. We successfully identified real problems and proposed measurable improvements, but struggled to draw a direct line between navigation changes and churn reduction. When the organization revisits this problem, the foundational research and ideas are ready to build from.
