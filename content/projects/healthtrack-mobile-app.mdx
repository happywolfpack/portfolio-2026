## Overview

HealthTrack is a mobile app that helps users monitor their daily health metrics. The existing app had low daily engagement and users frequently abandoned their tracking habits after the first week.

Our goal was to redesign the core experience to make health tracking feel effortless and rewarding.

## The Problem

<Callout type="insight">
User research revealed that 68% of users stopped logging after 7 days, citing the process as "too tedious" and "not rewarding enough."
</Callout>

Through interviews with 20 users, we identified three core pain points:

- **Too many steps** to log daily metrics
- **No sense of progress** or achievement
- **Generic experience** that didn't adapt to individual goals

## Process

<ProcessStep number={1} title="Discovery & Research">
We conducted 20 user interviews, analyzed usage data from 10,000 active accounts, and benchmarked against 8 competing health apps. This gave us a clear picture of where users were dropping off and why.
</ProcessStep>

<ProcessStep number={2} title="Ideation & Wireframing">
Working closely with the product team, we explored multiple concepts for simplifying the logging flow. We ran a design sprint to rapidly prototype and test three different approaches with real users.
</ProcessStep>

<ProcessStep number={3} title="Design & Prototyping">
Based on testing feedback, we refined the "Quick Log" concept — a single-screen experience that lets users log their key metrics in under 10 seconds. We built a high-fidelity prototype in Figma for a second round of testing.
</ProcessStep>

<ProcessStep number={4} title="Implementation & Iteration">
We worked with engineering through three iterative sprints, refining interactions and addressing edge cases. We also set up analytics to track the key engagement metrics we wanted to improve.
</ProcessStep>

## Solution

The redesigned experience centers on three key changes:

### Quick Log
A single-screen logging experience that reduces the daily check-in from 5 screens to 1. Users can log all their key metrics with simple tap and swipe gestures.

### Progress Streaks
A visual streak system that rewards consistency. Users see their current streak prominently displayed and receive gentle nudges to maintain it.

### Personalized Dashboard
An adaptive home screen that surfaces the metrics each user cares about most, based on their goals and usage patterns.

  <div className="rounded-lg bg-gray-100 p-8 text-center text-sm text-gray-400">Before: 5-screen logging flow</div>
  <div className="rounded-lg bg-gray-100 p-8 text-center text-sm text-gray-400">After: Single-screen Quick Log</div>
</BeforeAfter>

## Results

<Callout type="insight">
After launch, daily active users increased by 34% and the 30-day retention rate improved from 23% to 51%.
</Callout>

- **34% increase** in daily active users
- **51% 30-day retention** (up from 23%)
- **4.2 average seconds** to complete a daily log (down from 45 seconds)
- **4.6 star rating** on the App Store (up from 3.8)

## Reflection

This project reinforced my belief that reducing friction is often more impactful than adding features. By deeply understanding the daily experience of our users, we were able to make a small interaction change that had outsized results on engagement and retention.
