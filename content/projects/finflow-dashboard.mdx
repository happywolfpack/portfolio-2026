## Overview

FinFlow is a SaaS platform that helps small businesses manage their finances. The existing dashboard was data-heavy but lacked actionable insights, leading to low engagement with the analytics features.

## The Problem

<Callout type="insight">
Only 12% of users visited the analytics section more than once per week, despite it being the highest-value feature of the platform.
</Callout>

Small business owners are time-constrained. They needed quick, glanceable insights — not complex charts requiring financial expertise to interpret.

## Process

<ProcessStep number={1} title="User Research">
We shadowed 8 small business owners during their weekly financial review process and conducted follow-up interviews to understand their mental models around financial data.
</ProcessStep>

<ProcessStep number={2} title="Information Architecture">
We restructured the dashboard around the three questions users asked most frequently: "How am I doing?", "Where is my money going?", and "What should I do next?"
</ProcessStep>

<ProcessStep number={3} title="Visual Design">
We developed a clean, card-based layout with progressive disclosure — summary metrics at the top with the ability to drill into details on demand.
</ProcessStep>

## Solution

### Smart Summary Cards
At-a-glance cards showing revenue, expenses, and cash flow with clear trend indicators and plain-language explanations.

### Actionable Alerts
Proactive notifications like "Your subscription costs increased 15% this month" with one-click actions to investigate.

### Simplified Charts
Replaced complex multi-axis charts with focused, single-metric visualizations that tell a clear story.

## Results

- **3.2x increase** in weekly dashboard visits
- **47% reduction** in support tickets about financial data
- **Net Promoter Score** improved from 32 to 58
