## Overview

The design team at Buildertrend identified systematic inconsistencies across the product but struggled to convince all technology leaders that a design system was necessary. Initial attempts to prove the need through visual examples of inconsistency were dismissed as anecdotal concerns.

## The Problem

Stakeholders argued: "Why do we need a design system to fix that? We just need to be more careful." We needed concrete evidence beyond personal design experience to justify design system investment.

## Solution: Internal Workshop Research

We conducted structured interviews with four key groups: architects, developers, designers, and QA testers.

<ProcessStep number={1} title="Workshop Format">
Participants answered three core questions using sticky notes, which were then organized into thematic groups:
1. What design and development workflows currently work well?
2. What aspects aren't functioning effectively?
3. What workflow changes could address these issues?
</ProcessStep>

## Key Findings

**What was working:**
- Enhanced agile processes enabled greater team flexibility
- Figma mockups served effectively as a source of truth

**What wasn't working:**
- Misalignment between design and development libraries created confusion
- Unclear component usage guidelines
- No defined process for modifying or adding components
- Teams duplicated, misused, or created redundant components

<Callout type="insight">
An unexpected benefit emerged: facilitating dialogue among potential users allowed teams to recognize shared struggles and generate enthusiasm for the proposed solution.
</Callout>

## Recommendations

The research surfaced clear, consensus-driven recommendations:

1. **Synchronize** design and development libraries
2. **Strengthen** documentation and guidelines
3. **Establish single team ownership** of global components
4. **Create transparent processes** for component modifications

## Impact

Leadership aligned on design system necessity. Developers joined the team afterward, and stakeholder buy-in was achieved — not through design advocacy alone, but through user research that let the evidence speak for itself.

## Takeaways

<Callout type="note">
When design intuition isn't enough to convince stakeholders, turn to the same tool you'd use for any product problem: research. By giving potential users a structured way to voice their pain points, we built a case that was impossible to dismiss as anecdotal.
