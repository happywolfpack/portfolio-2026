## Overview

Buildertrend was transitioning to a structured model distinguishing editable from read-only content. I helped coordinate early design work, conduct user testing, and surface organizational misalignments that needed to be resolved before the pattern could scale.

## The Problem

The original UI presented all content in an editable state regardless of context. This created a cluttered, form-heavy experience that reduced scannability and increased cognitive load.

The solution direction was clear: introduce a true view state to simplify the interface and make important actions more prominent. Supporting data showed that most entities were viewed far more than edited, and "view/edit patterns" ranked in the top-3 needs across teams.

</BeforeAfter>

## Laying the Groundwork

I took several steps to move the pattern forward across the organization:

<ProcessStep number={1} title="Created a shared Figma file">
Built a cross-team Figma file for view/edit explorations, giving designers a common space to align on direction.
</ProcessStep>

<ProcessStep number={2} title="Planned and ran usability testing">
Tested on lower-risk implementation features to validate the pattern before scaling it to higher-stakes areas.
</ProcessStep>

<ProcessStep number={3} title="Shared findings with senior designers">
Surfaced findings and edge cases with the broader design team so decisions could be informed by real user behavior.
</ProcessStep>

<ProcessStep number={4} title="Flagged implementation divergence">
Identified that teams were interpreting the pattern differently, which catalyzed formal governance creation.
</ProcessStep>

<Callout type="insight">
Users overwhelmingly expected "Save" to return them to their previous context — a key finding that shaped the final pattern direction.
</Callout>

## Driving Alignment

Testing revealed conflicting interpretations across teams. There was a disconnect between user expectations and financial workflow requirements that needed organizational resolution.

Design leadership responded by creating a cross-functional working group with directors from design, product, and architecture. Together, we established three foundational decisions:

1. **Return users to previous context** after saving (when no follow-up action is needed)
2. **Elevate "Send" as the primary action** in create/edit modes
3. **Define editability rules** based on item status and context

<BeforeAfter beforeLabel="Before: Save keeps users on item" afterLabel="After: Send elevated, save returns">
  <img src="/images/projects/view-edit-pattern/save-as-primary.png" alt="Save transitions to view state, keeps users on item" />
  <img src="/images/projects/view-edit-pattern/send-as-primary.png" alt="Elevating send action allows save to act as return mechanism" />
</BeforeAfter>

## Looking Forward

Implementation is ongoing, but the foundation is established — a shared interaction model and aligned decisions documented in updated guidelines.

## Takeaways

<Callout type="note">
1. **Strategic clarity requires structural support.** Organizational alignment doesn't happen through design artifacts alone — it needs cross-functional governance.

2. **Impact without formal leadership.** By building connections and elevating patterns, I influenced platform-wide change without a leadership title.

3. **Early initiative surfaces misalignments.** Taking initiative early meant we found the real problems before they became entrenched in shipped features.
